# Federated Learning  

This repository contains my practice files and experimental work related to **Federated Learning**. It serves as a workspace for implementing and testing various federated learning algorithms in a decentralized setting.  

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure  
- `practice/` â€“ Basic implementations and tutorials  
- `experiments/` â€“ Experimental code and model evaluations  
- `notebooks/` â€“ Jupyter notebooks for testing different architectures  
- `datasets/` â€“ Preprocessing scripts and sample datasets  
- `docs/` â€“ Notes, findings, and research insights  

## ðŸš€ Goals  
- Explore federated learning concepts and techniques  
- Experiment with privacy-preserving ML approaches  
- Improve model performance across decentralized datasets  

This repository will be continuously updated as I progress in my learning and research.
